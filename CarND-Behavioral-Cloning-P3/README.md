## Introduction
**Behavioral Cloning Project-3**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Dataset
The dataset collected from [Udacity Self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The train data collected from each track A and B courses in 3-laps for forward direction only. Each images has 160x320x3 pixels and has 3 different camera viewpoint as center,left and right. For my train data has 13,977 examples and it augmented to 167,720 training samples.
### Dataset Exploration

The collected dataset is biased to 0 deg steering angle state. I applied data balancing approach to my dataset for generalizing the model performances.

### Preprocessing
The original image size generate from simulator is 160x320x3. I cropped the images top 60 pixels and bottom 20 pixels. It helps generalizing the model to remove the trees, rocks and etc from the input images. And images were resized to 64x64x3. It saved the memory size of augmentated image dataset. I tested image size to set as 32x128x3(same as Nvidia's paper), there was big changes for my case. RGB color space was used in this training data.

### Augmentation
I didn't applied much augmentation processing step. Only random brightness and flipping was added to augmentation steps. I tested random shadow, rotate, and translate approaches. But It wasn't much effects to get better performance and sometimes got worse results.

The final transformed images (Crop, Resize, brightness and flip) samples are below:

## Model
I used [Nvidia's End to End self driving CNN models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316) in this projects. It has 3 CNN layers and 3 Fully connected hidden layes. Activation function used 'elu'. Dropout are used in FC layes to prevent overfit. The optimizer is adam and the cost function is mean-squared-error.

### Architecture
The model architectures are below:

### Training
Train on 167,720 samples, validate on 8,387. Batch size is 128, epochs are 10. Early stopping callbacks applied.

### Notes
 * At first, I applied keras generator function to model training. But it was extremely slow to train, I changed it to saving datas to memory. I think when generator transmit the datas to GPU there was some bottleneck on network speeds because the train data was in NAS.
 * I collected the train data in track A only. It was not bad in track A but the car ran into the cliff in track B. I tried various data augmentation techniques, It was no differences. I collected only 3-laps from track B and the cars start to drive. I think it was much better to collect more data than data augmentation.
 * Use the analog joy-sticks, at least use the mouse steering.
 * Tested color spaces(YUV, HSV) but RGB was the best for my cases.
 * Random shadow, rotate, and translate approaches was not much effects to get better performance.
