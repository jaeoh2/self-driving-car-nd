# Project1 : **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**
## Introduction
Detecting lane lines on the Road using computer vison tools like OpenCV, python and Hough transform algorithm.
The goals of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road

## Pipeline description
My lane detection pipeline has 5-steps are below:
1. Pre-Process images : Converting gray scale, gaussian Blurring and canny transform.
1. Set Region of Interests in polygon shape.
1. Hough transform
1. Draw lane lines overlayed on original image
* To Draw lane lines as solid line, I stored entire x,y positions to lists.
